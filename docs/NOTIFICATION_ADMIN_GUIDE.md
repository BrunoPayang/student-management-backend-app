   - Filter by delivery status
3. Check delivery and read status for each user
4. Use bulk actions to update multiple records

### 3. Troubleshooting Failed Deliveries

1. Look for red ‚úó status indicators
2. Check the FCM error field for specific error messages
3. Verify user FCM tokens are valid
4. Use the "Resend Notifications" action to retry

### 4. School-Specific Management

- Provide detailed information in the body
- Select appropriate notification types for better organization
- Test with a small group before sending to all users

### 2. Monitoring and Maintenance
- Regularly check delivery status
- Monitor failed deliveries and investigate errors
- Use bulk actions for efficiency
- Archive old notifications when appropriate

### 3. User Management
- Keep target user lists updated
- Monitor user engagement through read status
- Use delivery data to improve notification strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Notifications not appearing in admin**:
   - Check if models are properly registered
   - Verify admin user has proper permissions
   - Check Django admin configuration

2. **Delivery status not updating**:
   - Verify notification service is working
   - Check FCM configuration
   - Review error logs

3. **Performance issues**:
   - Admin uses optimized queries
   - Consider pagination for large datasets
   - Use filters to narrow results

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Django admin logs
2. Verify notification service configuration
3. Review FCM and email service settings
4. Check user permissions and school assignments

## API Integration

The admin interface works alongside the notification API:
- Admin changes are reflected in API responses
- API-created notifications appear in admin
- Bulk operations can be performed through both interfaces
- Real-time status updates are maintained

## Security Considerations

- Only authenticated admin users can access the interface
- School staff are limited to their school's data
- System admins have full access to all notifications
- User privacy is maintained through proper filtering
