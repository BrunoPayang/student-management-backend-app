- **Relationship Types**: Father, mother, guardian, etc.
- **Primary Contact**: Only one primary contact per student
- **Emergency Contact**: Designated emergency contacts
- **Communication Preferences**: SMS, email, push notification settings
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate relationships

#### âœ… Academic Records Models

**Transcript Model:**
- Academic year and semester tracking
- File upload support (Firebase Storage URLs)
- GPA, credits, class ranking
- Upload tracking with user attribution
- Public/private visibility control

**BehaviorReport Model:**
- Positive/negative behavior tracking
- Severity levels and incident details
- Location and time tracking
- Actions taken and follow-up requirements
- Parent notification settings

**PaymentRecord Model:**
- Multiple payment types (tuition, fees, etc.)
- Status tracking (pending, paid, overdue)
- Due dates and payment methods
- Receipt URLs and reference numbers
- Overdue calculation methods

#### âœ… Student Admin Interface
- **Comprehensive List Views**: All models with relevant fields
- **Advanced Filtering**: Status, type, date ranges
- **Search Functionality**: Name, ID, reference number search
- **Organized Fieldsets**: Logical grouping of fields
- **Performance Optimized**: Select related queries

### Task 3.3: Database Migrations & Seeding

#### âœ… Migration System
- **Schools Migration**: Enhanced School model with UUID primary key
- **Students Migration**: Complete Student and related models
- **Database Indexes**: Performance-optimized indexes for common queries
- **Unique Constraints**: Proper data integrity enforcement
- **Foreign Key Relationships**: Correctly established relationships

#### âœ… Data Seeding Commands

**Seed Schools Command:**
- Realistic Niger school data
- Automatic configuration creation
- Customizable count parameter
- Proper error handling

**Seed Students Command:**
- Diverse student names (Nigerian context)
- Realistic age distribution (5-18 years)
- School-specific student IDs
- Random enrollment dates
- Configurable per-school seeding

#### âœ… Database Performance
- **Indexes**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Composite Indexes**: Multi-field query optimization
- **Foreign Key Indexes**: Relationship query performance
- **Unique Constraints**: Data integrity enforcement
